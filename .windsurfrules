## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

### File Organization
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)
- Group related components in feature-based directories
- Keep API routes organized by domain in the `app/api` directory
- Separate Hono middleware in a dedicated `middleware` directory

### Directory Structure
- Implement colocation by organizing page-specific components, actions, and hooks within the page directory:

```
src
|
+-- app        # Next.js routing files (standard Next.js structure)
|   |
|   +-- page-name/
|       |
|       +-- page.tsx
|       +-- _components/  # Page-specific components
|       +-- _actions/     # Page-specific actions
|       +-- _hooks/       # Page-specific hooks
|
+-- components # Cross-cutting UI components (not domain-specific)
|
+-- hooks      # Cross-cutting, domain-independent hooks
|
+-- providers  # Application providers
|
+-- utils      # General utility functions
|
+-- constants  # Application-wide constants
|
+-- types      # Shared type definitions
|
+-- styles     # CSS and styling related files
|
+-- lib        # Shared library code and standardized processes
|
+-- tests      # Automated testing files
```

- Use underscore prefix (_components, _actions, _hooks) for page-specific directories to clearly distinguish them from route segments
- Keep cross-cutting, domain-independent components, hooks, and utilities in the top-level directories
- Prioritize colocation to improve maintainability and reduce unnecessary imports

### TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define strict types for API requests and responses
- Use Zod schemas for validation and type inference

### Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX
- Follow Biome formatting rules
- Use single quotes for strings as configured in Biome

## UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach
- Maintain consistent spacing and color schemes
- Use Tailwind's utility classes instead of custom CSS when possible
- Extract common UI patterns into reusable components

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC)
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading
- Implement proper caching strategies for API routes

### Form Handling
- Use React Hook Form for managing form state and validation
- Integrate Zod schemas with React Hook Form for type-safe form validation
- Implement form error handling consistently across the application
- Use controlled components with React Hook Form for complex form interactions
- Create reusable form components for common patterns

## Hono Integration

### API Routes
- Use Hono for API routes in `app/api` directory
- Organize routes by domain using Hono's `app.route()` method
- Avoid creating "controller" classes; use direct handlers with proper typing
- Use Hono's middleware for cross-cutting concerns

```typescript
// Example: app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { handle } from 'hono/vercel';
import { books } from './books';
import { authors } from './authors';

const app = new Hono().basePath('/api');

// Mount domain-specific routes
app.route('/books', books);
app.route('/authors', authors);

export const GET = handle(app);
export const POST = handle(app);
export const PUT = handle(app);
export const DELETE = handle(app);
```

### Middleware
- Create reusable middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling
- Use Hono's middleware composition for complex request processing
- Implement rate limiting for public-facing APIs

```typescript
// Example: middleware/auth.ts
import { Context, Next } from 'hono';
import { verify } from 'jsonwebtoken';

export function authMiddleware() {
  return async (c: Context, next: Next) => {
    const token = c.req.header('Authorization')?.split(' ')[1];

    if (!token) {
      return c.json({ message: 'Unauthorized' }, 401);
    }

    try {
      const decoded = verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET!);
      c.set('user', decoded);
      await next();
    } catch {
      return c.json({ message: 'Invalid token' }, 401);
    }
  };
}
```

### API Security
- Validate all input with Zod schemas
- Sanitize data to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper error handling and avoid exposing sensitive information
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement CORS restrictions for production environments

```typescript
// Example: Validation with Zod
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zValidator } from '@hono/zod-validator';

const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(3).max(50),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

app.post('/users', zValidator('json', userSchema), async (c) => {
  const data = c.req.valid('json');
  // Process validated data
  return c.json({ success: true });
});
```

## Key Conventions
- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR
  - Use only for Web API access in small components
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management
- Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing
- Use Biome for consistent code formatting and linting

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Create integration tests for API routes using Hono's testing utilities
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Use mock data for testing to avoid external dependencies

## Deployment
- Use Vercel for production deployments
- Implement proper environment variable management
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Configure proper caching strategies for static assets
