# Next-Stage

A modern, type-safe Next.js starter template designed for AI-driven development.

## Features

- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router, Hono
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form
- **Form Validation**: Zod
- **Linting & Formatting**: Biome, Markuplint
- **Testing**: Playwright, Bun

## Getting Started
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
bun install
```

Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed for speed, complete with a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager.

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to manage dependencies and run scripts.

### Environment Setup（Optional）
If you want to use environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

2. Update the environment variables in `.env.local` as needed.

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
# Using bun
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Code Quality with Biome and Markuplint

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting JavaScript/TypeScript code. Biome is a fast, modern JavaScript/TypeScript toolchain that replaces ESLint and Prettier.

Additionally, [Markuplint](https://markuplint.dev/) is used for linting JSX/TSX markup to ensure high-quality, accessible, and consistent UI components.

### Available Commands

```bash
# Run development server
bun run dev

# Run production build
bun run build

# Run all linters (Markuplint and Biome)
bun run lint

# Run both linting and formatting with auto-fixes
bun run check

# Run unit tests
bun run test:unit

# Run e2e tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run UI mode tests
bun run test:e2e:ui

# Run e2e codegen
bun run test:codegen
```

## AI-Driven Development Rules
This project supports AI-assisted development with predefined rules for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

Supported AI Editors:
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Windsurf Editor by Codeium](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

### Generating Editor-Specific Rules

You can generate editor-specific rule files from the base rules located in the `_llm-rules` directory using the following commands:

```bash
# Generate rules for Cursor editor
bun run rules:cursor

# Generate rules for Windsurf editor
bun run rules:windsurf

# Generate rules for GitHub Copilot (instructions)
bun run rules:copilot

# Generate rules for all supported editors
bun run rules
```

These commands copy the base rules and adapt them for the specified editor's format (e.g., `.cursor/rules/cursor-*.mdc`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).

## Turbopack

This project is configured to use [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) in development mode for faster refresh rates and improved developer experience.
